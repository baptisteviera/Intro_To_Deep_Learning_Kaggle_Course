Sometimes though you'll want to put some other layer between the `Dense` layer and its activation function. (We'll see an example of this in Lesson 5 with *batch normalization*.) In this case, we can define the activation in its own `Activation` layer, like so:\n\n```\nlayers.Dense(units=8),\nlayers.Activation('relu')\n```\n\nThis is completely equivalent to the ordinary way: `layers.Dense(units=8, activation='relu')`.\n\nRewrite the following model so that each activation is in its own `Activation` layer.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"### YOUR CODE HERE: rewrite this to use activation layers\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n    \n    layers.Dense(32, input_shape=[8]),\n    layers.Activation( activation='relu'),\n    \n    layers.Dense(32),\n    layers.Activation( activation='relu'),\n    \n    layers.Dense(1),\n])\n\n# Check your answer\nq_3.check()","metadata":{"lines_to_next_cell":0,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-12T14:13:12.711872Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-12T14:13:12.712297Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-12T14:13:12.755213Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-12T14:13:12.712267Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-12T14:13:12.754272Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#q_3.hint()\n#q_3.solution()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Optional: Alternatives to ReLU #\n\nThere is a whole family of variants of the `'relu'` activation -- `'elu'`, `'selu'`, and `'swish'`, among others -- all of which you can use in Keras.
